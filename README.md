Low product-market fit / low user traction — Some ZK-native protocols (or derivatives on StarkNet) failed or shuttered due to minimal user activity and weak token/economic design. ZKX's shutdown is an explicit example. 
Unchained

Liquidity fragmentation & low TVL — New ZK-native markets on L2s often struggle to attract sufficient liquidity vs established L1/L2 incumbents; early-mover L2 risk also fragments LPs. (zkFinance shows early-stage TVL/usage metrics). 
DeFi Llama

Engineering complexity & cost of proof generation — ZK proofs require additional engineering, toolchains and sometimes expensive/slow proof generation; teams underestimate developer ops & runtime cost tradeoffs. 
Rapid Innovation

Composability & oracle dependencies — Lending protocols depend heavily on price oracles and composability. On some ZK stacks these integrations are less mature, increasing integration risk. 
Chainlink

Regulatory & KYC tradeoffs — Privacy features create friction with AML/KYC expectations. Research points to ZK approaches that allow selective disclosure, but building compliant flows is still nontrivial.

User experience (UX) and onboarding — ZK-enabled flows add conceptual complexity (proofs, bridging, L2 deposits), hurting mainstream adoption unless abstracted away. Observed across new L2-native apps.
